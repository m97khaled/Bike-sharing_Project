# Bike-sharing_Project

Used Python to explore data related to bike-sharing systems for three major cities in the 
United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
Written a code that imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by 
computing descriptive statistics. Furthermore, a script was written that takes in raw input to 
create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Used Python 3 libraries: NumPy and pandas.
